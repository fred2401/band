            <h3>Who are we?</h3>
                <p>We are a German  folk group originating from Kassel, consisting of 
                   lead vocalist and guitarist Clemens Rehbein, bassist and percussionist
                   Philipp Dausch and me, the guitarist, Antonio Greger.
                </p>
                <p>Our first single was stolen dance, I really enjoyed making it especially 
                    after getting attention from <span class="spin">SPIN</span> as he called 
                    it a <span class="comment">"erenely rollicking crossover jam"</span>. Then
                    came the release of our album sadnecessary which boomed, I was happy to see 
                    people enjoy our music you know. So that's us.
                </p>
